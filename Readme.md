Now shops in your city are at your fingertips.

Problem Statement: 
-------------------

In today's time, suffering from a global pandemic, we need to change how we function for various tasks. One of the problems we have is not to gather around. Many a time, we see retail businesses having many customers gathered in their shops and outlets, which is not safe considering pandemic, this causes chaos and customers to have to wait for a long for their chance to come and to purchase items/products, especially in populated countries like China and India.

Project Description:
--------------------

We have two problems to tackle here:

   1. Too many people gather at a single place, at the same time.

   2. Customers have to wait for their order, in case of a crowd.

The solution to these problems is a platform, which allow the retail owners to register their shop/outlet on it, and they can add all their products on it, which will be shown to their profile on the platform.

For each retail profile, the platform will generate a unique QR code attached to their profile, which customers can scan to virtually enter the shop and can see products listed for that shop by the shopkeeper.

Now customers once entered the shop can select products he/she wants to buy from that shop, after finishing they can confirm their order and get a code for their order.

The shopkeeper gets a notification of the order placed by the customer, then he can start preparing the product basket for that particular order, once complete he can mark the order as ready, the customer will get notified that his order is ready for pick up, he will go to the shop, give the order code to the shopkeeper and pick his order. There will also be a feature for the contact-less transaction for customers.

By this process and with the help of the platform, not only we can reduce the number of people who have to gather together but also reduce the waiting time for customers as well as for shopkeepers, which helps them to serve even more customers at a single time, thus increases sales.
